<h1>Example 1: Downloading Block Group Data and Exporting to CSV<a class="headerlink" href="#example-1-downloading-block-group-data-and-exporting-to-csv" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As a first example, let’s suppose we’re interested in unemployment and
high school dropout rates for block groups in Cook County, Illinois,
which contains Chicago, IL.</p>
<p>We begin by importing the censusdata and pandas modules, and setting
some display options in pandas for nicer output:</p>
<div class="code ipython3 highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">pd</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">censusdata</span>
<span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;display.expand_frame_repr&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;display.precision&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To download data, we need to identify the relevant tables containing the
variables of interest to us. One way to do this would be to refer to the
ACS documentation, in particular the Table Shells
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html</a>).
Alternatively, it is possible to do this from within Python.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">censusdata.search</span></code> will search for given text patterns. The downside
to this is output can be voluminous, as in the following searches, as
ACS frequently provides a large number of different tabulations related
to a given topic area. ipython provides easier to read output in this
case:</p>
<div class="code ipython3 highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">censusdata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;acs5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;2015&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;label&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;unemploy&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

because otherwise every time we did this we would have to download data
for all variables.) Once we have identified a table of interest, we can

<p>After identifying relevant variables, we then need to identify the

code) for Illinois, then the identifiers for all counties with Illinois
to find Cook County:</p>

</table><p>In this simple model, the percentage voting Democratic is not
significantly associated with population size or % Hispanic, at the
p&lt;.05 level. It is significantly associated with median household income
and the % non-Hispanic black. Every $1,000 increase in median household
income is associated with an increase of just under 1 percentage point
in the Democratic vote. Every one percentage point increase in the %
non-Hispanic black is associated with about a half a percentage point
increase in the Democratic vote. Of course,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The outcome variable is not continuous, due to its bounded range, and
this model does not account for this (it is essentially a linear
probability model);</li>
<li>The choice of covariates is simplistic and just designed to
demonstrate fitting a model;</li>
<li>We might consider robust standard errors for this model.</li>
