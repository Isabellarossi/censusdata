Example 1: Downloading Block Group Data and Exporting to CSV
============================================================

As a first example, let's suppose we're interested in unemployment and
high school dropout rates for block groups in Cook County, Illinois,
which contains Chicago, IL.

We begin by importing the censusdata and pandas modules, and setting
some display options in pandas for nicer output:

.. code:: ipython3

    import pandas as pd
    import censusdata
    pd.set_option('display.expand_frame_repr', False)
    pd.set_option('display.precision', 2)

To download data, we need to identify the relevant tables containing the
variables of interest to us. One way to do this would be to refer to the
ACS documentation, in particular the Table Shells
(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html).
Alternatively, it is possible to do this from within Python.
``censusdata.search`` will search for given text patterns. The downside
to this is output can be voluminous, as in the following searches, as
ACS frequently provides a large number of different tabulations related
to a given topic area. ipython provides easier to read output in this
case:

.. code:: ipython3

    censusdata.search('acs5', '2015', 'label', 'unemploy')

(Please note that searching Census variables and printing out a single
table rely on previously downloaded information from the Census API,
because otherwise every time we did this we would have to download data
for all variables.) Once we have identified a table of interest, we can
use ``censusdata.printtable`` to show all variables included in the
table:

After identifying relevant variables, we then need to identify the

to find Cook County:

     'Woodford County, Illinois': censusgeo((('state', '17'), ('county', '203')))}



Now that we have identified the variables and geographies of interest,
we can download the data using ``censusdata.download`` and compute
variables for the percent unemployed and the percent with no high school
degree:

.. code:: ipython3

    cookbg = censusdata.download('acs5', '2015',
                                 censusdata.censusgeo([('state', '17'), ('county', '031'), ('block group', '*')]),

                                  'B15003_014E', 'B15003_015E', 'B15003_016E'])
    cookbg['percent_unemployed'] = cookbg.B23025_005E / cookbg.B23025_003E * 100
    cookbg['percent_nohs'] = (cookbg.B15003_002E + cookbg.B15003_003E + cookbg.B15003_004E
                              + cookbg.B15003_005E + cookbg.B15003_006E + cookbg.B15003_007E + cookbg.B15003_008E

    cookbg = cookbg[['percent_unemployed', 'percent_nohs']]
    cookbg.describe()

Next, we show the 30 block groups in Cook County with the highest rate
of unemployment, and the percent with no high school degree in those
block groups.

Example 2: Downloading Data for All U.S. Counties
=================================================

Using the Detail Tables
-----------------------

For this example, let's suppose we have looked up the variables we need
by referring to the Table Shells. We begin by downloading the data and
checking the data we have received:

Using the Data Profile Tables
=============================

There is more than one way to approach this problem. Let's see how to
use the data profile tables for the same purpose. First, we identify the
appropriate table:

.. code:: ipython3

    censusdata.search('acs5', '2015', 'label', '65', tabletype='profile')




.. parsed-literal::

    [('DP02PR_0012E',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Nonfamily households!!Householder living alone!!65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0012M',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Nonfamily households!!Householder living alone!!65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0012PE',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Nonfamily households!!Householder living alone!!65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0012PM',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Nonfamily households!!Householder living alone!!65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0014E',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Households with one or more people 65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0014M',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Households with one or more people 65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0014PE',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Households with one or more people 65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0014PM',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'HOUSEHOLDS BY TYPE!!Total households!!Households with one or more people 65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0076E',
      'SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PUERTO RICO',
      'DISABILITY STATUS OF THE CIVILIAN NONINSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATION!!65 years and over'),
     ('DP02PR_0076M',

After identifying the relevant variables, we download and describe the
data, and compute the percent 65+ similarly to how we did so before,
except now the computation is somewhat simpler:

.. code:: ipython3

    county65plus = censusdata.download('acs5', '2015', censusdata.censusgeo([('county', '*')]),
                                       ['DP05_0001E', 'DP05_0014PE', 'DP05_0015PE', 'DP05_0016PE',],
                                       tabletype='profile')
    county65plus.describe()

export data for all counties to CSV:

    county65plus.head(30)

Example 3: Downloading State Data
=================================

For this example, we will be running a simple linear regression model,
so we need an additional import:

.. code:: ipython3

    import statsmodels.formula.api as sm

We begin by downloading data on some basic socioeconomic characteristics
for all U.S. states:

.. code:: ipython3

    statedata = censusdata.download('acs5', '2015', censusdata.censusgeo([('state', '*')]),
                                    ['B01001_001E', 'B19013_001E', 'B19083_001E',
                                     'C17002_001E', 'C17002_002E', 'C17002_003E', 'C17002_004E',
                                     'B03002_001E', 'B03002_003E', 'B03002_004E', 'B03002_012E',])

We then link data on the percent of voters in each state voting
Democratic in the 2016 U.S. presidential election:

.. code:: ipython3

    voting2016 = {
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '01'),)): 34.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '02'),)): 37.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '04'),)): 45.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '05'),)): 33.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '06'),)): 61.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '08'),)): 47.2,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '09'),)): 54.5,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '10'),)): 53.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '11'),)): 92.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '12'),)): 47.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '13'),)): 45.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '15'),)): 62.3,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '16'),)): 27.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '17'),)): 55.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '18'),)): 37.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '19'),)): 42.2,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '20'),)): 36.2,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '21'),)): 32.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '22'),)): 38.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '23'),)): 47.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '24'),)): 60.5,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '25'),)): 60.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '26'),)): 47.3,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '27'),)): 46.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '28'),)): 39.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '29'),)): 38,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '30'),)): 36,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '31'),)): 34,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '32'),)): 47.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '33'),)): 47.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '34'),)): 55,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '35'),)): 48.3,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '36'),)): 58.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '37'),)): 46.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '38'),)): 27.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '39'),)): 43.5,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '40'),)): 28.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '41'),)): 51.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '42'),)): 47.6,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '44'),)): 55.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '45'),)): 40.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '46'),)): 31.7,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '47'),)): 34.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '48'),)): 43.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '49'),)): 27.8,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '50'),)): 61.1,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '51'),)): 49.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '53'),)): 54.4,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '54'),)): 26.5,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '55'),)): 46.9,
        censusdata.censusgeo((('state', '56'),)): 22.5,
    }
    voting2016 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(voting2016, orient='index')
    statedata['percent_democratic_pres_2016'] = voting2016

We then rename columns, compute some additional variables, and rescale
some variables to make regression coefficients more easily
interpretable:

.. code:: ipython3

    statedata = statedata.rename(columns={'B01001_001E': 'population_size'})
    statedata.population_size = statedata.population_size / 100000
    statedata = statedata.rename(columns={'B19013_001E': 'median_HH_income'})
    statedata['median_HH_income'] = statedata['median_HH_income'] / 1000
    statedata = statedata.rename(columns={'B19083_001E': 'gini_index'})
    statedata.gini_index = statedata.gini_index * 100
    statedata['percent_below_125_poverty'] = (statedata['C17002_002E'] + statedata['C17002_003E'] + statedata['C17002_004E']) / statedata['C17002_001E'] * 100
    statedata['percent_nonhisp_white'] = statedata['B03002_003E'] / statedata['B03002_001E'] * 100
    statedata['percent_nonhisp_black'] = statedata['B03002_004E'] / statedata['B03002_001E'] * 100
    statedata['percent_hispanic'] = statedata['B03002_012E'] / statedata['B03002_001E'] * 100

We run a quick check on the data and then delete variables we no longer
need:

.. code:: ipython3

    assert (statedata['population_size'] == statedata['B03002_001E'] / 100000).all()
    for column in ['C17002_001E', 'C17002_002E', 'C17002_003E', 'C17002_004E',
                   'B03002_001E', 'B03002_003E', 'B03002_004E', 'B03002_012E',]:
        del statedata[column]

We are only interested in the 50 states + DC, so we drop Puerto Rico:

.. code:: ipython3

    statedata = statedata.drop([censusdata.censusgeo([('state', '72')])])

Finally, we reorder the variables and run simple descriptives:

.. code:: ipython3

    statedata = statedata.reindex(columns=['percent_democratic_pres_2016', 'population_size', 'median_HH_income', 'percent_below_125_poverty', 'gini_index', 'percent_nonhisp_white', 'percent_nonhisp_black', 'percent_hispanic'])
    statedata.describe()

In this simple model, the percentage voting Democratic is not
significantly associated with population size or % Hispanic, at the
p<.05 level. It is significantly associated with median household income
and the % non-Hispanic black. Every $1,000 increase in median household
income is associated with an increase of just under 1 percentage point
in the Democratic vote. Every one percentage point increase in the %
non-Hispanic black is associated with about a half a percentage point
increase in the Democratic vote. Of course,

1. The outcome variable is not continuous, due to its bounded range, and
   this model does not account for this (it is essentially a linear
   probability model);
2. The choice of covariates is simplistic and just designed to
   demonstrate fitting a model;
3. We might consider robust standard errors for this model.
